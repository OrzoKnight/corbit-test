# January 12, Year 0
*from: Cornelius Akbrand*

Dear residents,

It's a new age! Humanity has literally blasted off to a new, prosperous future. We are the sole hope for our race, and we are leaving our home planet, hoping to find our way among the stars.

Because of this, we have decided that a new dating system is in order. The year 2133 no longer has meaning to us; those are Earth years. We are no longer there. Since eons of evolution have us humans accustomed to a 24-hour cycle, and we will continue to use this cycle. We will continue to use our regular days and months (why reinvent the wheel?), but we are reseting the clock to year 0. Launch day is now officially January 1, Year 0. Our new calendar is conveniently aligned to Earth's calendar.

So happy new year, happy new age.

## Notes

**From: Sam Formacek, Marketing Chief**  
We understand what Cornelius is trying to do, but the tone is unprofessional and, frankly uninspired. Please revise.

**From: Office of Cornelius Akbrand**  
Cornelius has final say. Deliver as is.

**From: Sam Formacek, Marketing Chief**  
No. Have Cornelius see me.

**From: Cornelius Akbrand**  
Sam, please deliver the message. Thomas and I are not changing the voice and tone of CorBit just because we've gone "global." Let's all discuss this soon.
