TO: All Security Shift Captains
FROM: Jonathon Fitztorvalds, Chief of Security  
DATE: Jan 16, Year 0  
SUBJECT: For fuck's sakes

PRIORITY: URGENT

3 more residents caught in secure areas since yesterday, all in the lower 10 levels. WHAT IS GOING ON DOWN THERE??? One had a camera on him! An honest-to-God, 35mm film camera! I thought all residents were THOROUGHLY searched? Guess not.

Kat is putting together mandatory drone and human patrol schedules, follow them to the letter. She will also have some questions about this camera business. A directive from her must be treated as a directive from this office.

If you need a reminder of what a security leak can mean for you and me, think back at Solaris United Arcology's demise. And now think about the fact that we're in space.
