# The View from 35,000 Feet
*Selection from The Arc Weekly*

I am writing this as I look out my window. The vastness of space fills half my view, and the starry darkness beautifully frames the slight curvature of my birth planet, Earth, as it fills the other half.

What a weird concept, a birth planet. Every human who is born from this day forward will be an extraterrestrial. Have you stopped to think about that? Human history is starting a new chapter, as Cornelius Akbrand so eloquently reminded us on his "Year Zero" message. Think what you will of him (I personally think he's a great human), he's right. We're blasting off into the unknown, never to return.

I was one of the lucky ones who was plucked from the masses at the last minute; I literally boarded this vessel 26 hours before lift off. I had declined the original invitation, 5-odd years back, thinking I was standing for something by standing against CorBit. My column was never overly critical, I believe, of CBA (CorBit Arcologies), but I opposed a global conglomerate, a company so vast and all-encompassing that its reach was beyond the comprehension of any one person.

My views changed somewhat two years later, when CorBit Health announced their revolutionary cancer treatment, and I made a complete u-turn when they made all cancer treatment available for free worldwide a year later. I believe that was the moment when all resistance vanished, when the world gave itself over to the benevolent entity. Cornelius Akbrand and Thomas R. Bitley became legends in their own time, saviors of humanity, the men who would single-handedly save the world (no pun intended).

The reason for the history lesson is this: I will not soon forget what CorBit did for humanity in the recent past (nor should any of us); yet, even as I am thankful on a daily basis for my very life, I remain cautious and vigilant. Something's going on in the "maintenance areas," all of which are off-limits to us residents. People who wander into these areas go missing for hours, then reappear, denying it ever happened. What did they see?

More to come. For now, I can only offer you this advice: Remain cautious and vigilant like me.
