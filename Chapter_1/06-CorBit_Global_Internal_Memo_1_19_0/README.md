SUBJECT: Did you read Yatta's column?

If you haven't had a chance, I highly recommend it. You can't miss it, it's fucking everywhere.

Jonathon and I discussed Yatta and decided not to label him/her a hostile actor just yet. Yatta will from now on be under constant surveillance; we want to intercept any messages he/she receives and run a full liability report on them before he/she can read them. That way we can at least what's coming; and if necessary, we can intercept the source of the message.

Let's see how this plays out.
