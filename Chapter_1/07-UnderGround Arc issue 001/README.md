Welcome to the first issue of UnderGround Arc!
==============================================

We survived! Yes, we are here with you on the Arc, ready to uncover the ugly underbelly of the beast. Since 
there is vaaary little freedom and privacy in our new home, we are coming to you in this new format, and 
beamed directly to your eyeballs!

As always, we appreciate your support and your help in maintaining our publication's distribution secure. 
If you know of someone who would enjoy being part of our exclusive club, send us their name, district, and 
ResID for vetting.

The scoop this week
-------------------

We've been here less than two weeks and we've already seen bits of a super-secret CorBit document. Two days 
an anonymous fan sent us what appeared to be a partly-encrypted file. This person has been a loyal fan and 
has provided us with some juicy bits in the past, so we have full confidence that the document is legitimate.

After 36 or so hours of work, we determined that the file was not partially encrypted, but it was in fact, 
partially corrupted. But what we are able to read, is nothing short of amazing: It reveals a position at 
CorBit Global which nobody had ever heard of before, the Master Historian.

If CorBit is good at something, is at naming their positions! We have very little information other than 
the partial document, but we now know that the Master Historian keeps records of every piece of media that 
exists which relates to CorBit in any way.

Here's the interesting part: We believe this includes private conversations captured by the cameras and 
microphones that exist in every single room in every single CorBit Global facility, this vessel included. 
Bathrooms, I believe, are the only exception.

Our new task
------------

Clearly, we have to find this Master Historian! We don't know when the document was generated, so we don't 
know if the position has been filled or not. But the UnderGround Club has never shied away from a challenge! 
Please contact us with any clues, tips, or any other kind of info you can share with us to help us further 
our investigation. Mark your messages with PMH (Project: Master Historian).

Until next week...
