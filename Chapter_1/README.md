## CorBit Global - Internal Memo

TO: All Security Personnel  
FROM: Jonathon Fitztorvalds, Chief of Security  
DATE: June 14, Year 0  
SUBJECT: Residents NOT ALLOWED in restricted areas

PRIORITY: URGENT

It is IMPERATIVE that residents of your assigned vessel are kept away from maintenance and secure areas. There have been no less than five incidents where residents wandered into sensitive areas. This is absolutely unacceptable, and could prove catastrophic. I cannot emphasize this enough.

When encountering a resident in a restricted area, immediately escort them out. Don't forget to give them the CorBit treatment, always polite, always cheerful, we are happy they are here.

If the resident is suspected of having accessed any restricted materials or witnessed any restricted activities, they must be incapacitated, taken to the Main Security Hub VIA THE MAINTENANCE TUNNELS, and the Security Captain on Duty must be alerted and briefed immediately.

If said resident resists, DEADLY FORCE IS AUTHORIZED. We cannot afford to give warnings.

We are a small force and therefore I understand we can't be everywhere at once. Take advantage of the CorBit Tech Sentry Drones, we have lots of them and for a reason. Shift captains should schedule as many drone patrols as they deem necessary to cover all entrances to restricted areas. IMPORTANT: Drones are NOT authorized to use deadly force unless a human is present.

Keep the peace.
