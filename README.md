Hello, {{ resident.firstName }}!

You made it! We want to be the first ones to congratulate you on surviving the apocalypse. CorBit Global is happy to have you onboard the {{ resident.vessel.vesselName }}, and our number one goal is to make you feel welcome and comfortable in your new home. We hope we've accomplished this goal.

By now you have already been assigned a {{ resident.dwelling.type }} in the {{ resident.dwelling.district }} district. We're sure you're going to love it there! The representative for your district is {{ resident.dwelling.district.representative.firstName }}. Make sure you say hi at the next Town Hall meeting. {{ resident.dwelling.district.representative.firstName}}'s contact information has been loaded into your home's digital control panel, in case you need to get in touch.

### What's next?

As you can imagine, we get this question a lot. The answer is: we're working on it.

The truth is, we were forced to leave Earth earlier than anticipated, and a full plan for the {{ resident.vessel.vesselName }} was not finalized before our departure. But don't fret! The good people at CorBit Global are working tirelessly to figure things out.

It's important to note that the {{ resident.vessel.vesselName }} is fully functional and flight-ready. None of its {{ resident.vessel.vesselName.livePopulation }} residents are now nor have they ever been in any danger.

### The immediate future

We are currently holding a high Earth orbit at around 35,000 kilometers above the surface. If you could see through the clouds, you would notice that we are on a geostationary orbit over the {{ resident.vessel.geostationaryOrbitLocation }} ocean. We are scheduled to hold this orbit for the next few months, while the CorBit Global Master Scientists determine our next move.

In the next few days, we hope your life will begin to resemble normalcy. You are scheduled to begin your job at {{ resident.occupationPrimary.workLocation }} as {{ resident.occupationPrimary }} on {{ resident.occupationPrimary.startDate }} at 9am sharp, like everybody else on the {{ resident.vessel.vesselName }}. That should give you a few days to get settled and ready to start a new life.

### Once again...

Thank you for putting your life, and the lives of your loved ones, in CorBit Global's hands.

*We are happy you are here!*

Sincerely,

**Cornelius Akbrand** *and* **Thomas R. Bitley**,  
Joint Presidents,  
CorBit Global
